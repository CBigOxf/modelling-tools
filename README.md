- **start-exp**: script to select and run NetLogo BehaviorSpace experiments conveniently
- **confidence-interval-plotting**: R scripts to parse output from a BehaviorSpace experiment, calculate confidence intervals for every time point and plot it using ggplot. Can be run on the server entirely or do the bigger part on the server using the "server" script, then download the Rdata file it generates and run the "plotting" script locally to be able to tweak the plot on the go.
